Chrome extensions are a bit different. They rely on a file called manifest.json.

Think of the manifest.json as the extension's passport. It tells the browser:

-Who the extension is (Name, Version).

-Where it wants to go (Permissions).

-What scripts it needs to run.

We need to explicitly ask the user for permission to read their email data.
